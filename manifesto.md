# The Small Big Data Manifesto

* We (humans) produce more and more data every day.

* Unless you work for Google, chances are your "big data" is not that big at all.

* What used to be "big" yesterday is "large-ish" today and will be "small" tomorrow.

* Definitions of "big data" usually refer to more attributes of the data than just sheer volume.

* Big data technologies are great for data that is truly big.

* Setting up a cluster of machines for many "big data" applications would be overkill and not financially viable.

* Ergo, most users are stuck with laptops, workstations or individual servers.

* The tools we have for those tend to break even for modest amounts of data.

* Ergo, we need new tools, inspired by the "big data" hype, that can process larger amounts of data
  without requiring the hardware- and management overhead of current "big data" technologies.
