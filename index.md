# Welcome to the World of Small Big Data

You may thing "what the heck?" - what is that supposed to mean? Right, read our
[Manifesto](manifesto.html).

If you want to know more about the people who cooked this up, head over to [About Us](aboutus.html).

Or have a look at the [Software](https://github.com/SmallBigData) we produce. 

We work on solutions in the following areas:

* Project Management (Ilia's PhD)
* Big Data Streams - efficient local "big data" style processing of larger datasets (Eric Lin)
* Data Representation - LEON (currently a Senior Honours Project proposal at St Andrews)
* Data management - CastInStone (lead: Alex Voss)
* Provenance - ???
