# Welcome to the<br />World of Small Big Data

You may think "What the heck?" - what is that supposed to mean? In a nutshell, many people using
"big data" technologies use data that is not all that "big" in terms of volume. We want to make life 
easier for these people. Have a look at our [Manifesto](manifesto.html).

If you want to know more about the people who cooked this up, head over to [About Us](aboutus.html)
or have a look at our [Projects](projects.html) and the [Software](https://github.com/SmallBigData) 
we produce. 

We work on solutions in the following areas:

* [Project Management](scorecards/index.html) - Data Science Scorecards (Ilia's PhD)
* Efficient local "big data" style processing - Big Data Streams (Eric Lin's MSc dissertation, supervisors: Alex Voss
  and Jon Lewis)
* Data Representation - LEON (Keanan Frazer, Senior Honours project, supervisors: Alex Voss and Jon Lewis)
* Data management - CastInStone (lead: Alex Voss)

[commane]: AV: absolutely. Partly addressed by CastInStone as I see it.
