# About Us 

We are a bunch of academics and students from the 
[School of Computer Science](https://www.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk) 
at the [University of St Andrews](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk) in Scotland.
Through our research and teaching, we all had something to do with big data 
technologies and we found that while they may work well for the likes of Google, 
Amazon or Facebook, there were also a wide range of possible uses of data of 
more moderate size that could be processed on individual servers, workstations 
or even laptops if only there were tools available that implement "big data"
principles at a more modest scale.
